# Getting Started
Requires Node >= 8.0.0

Clone the repo and run `npm install`

Start the server by running `npm start`

Watch for less changes and recompile by running `npm run watch-less`

Tooling is still a work-in-progress, so running both the less watch task and server simultaneously will require two separate terminals.
